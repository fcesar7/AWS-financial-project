# End-to-end Hybrid Data Architecture

## Project Description

This project consists on building an end-to-end data project. The data architecture is hybrid, meaning it is partly hosted on cloud services provider AWS and partly locally. It focus on extracting financial data via API services from Alpha Vantage and St. Louis Fed Web Services (FRED API), applying an XGBoost machine learning algorithm to evaluate the price of gold.
